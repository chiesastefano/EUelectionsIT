**Author:** Stefano Chiesa


Is there a relationship between the turnout of the European Parliament elections in Italy and the percentage of votes received by pro-EU parties? In this project, I will analyze the data from the European Parliament elections in Italy to answer this question. 

I performed the following steps:
- Load and inspect the data;
- Calculate the correlation between the turnout and the votes for pro-EU parties;
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between turnout and votes for pro-EU parties.
